# BMI Calculator

## Overview

The BMI Calculator is a Python-based GUI application built with the `tkinter` library. It allows users to:

- Calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering weight and height.
- Convert their height from feet and inches into meters.

This project is beginner-friendly and serves as a practical demonstration of building graphical user interfaces and handling basic calculations in Python.
